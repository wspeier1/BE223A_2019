align 2d image with two points from 3d images.
	use the pins in the preopt images and the DBS electrodes in the post opt images.  this can estimate parallax.

after alignment, go layer by layer until the edge of the brain is found. that is where the electrode will go

what needs to be labelled
	2d - electrodes, pins, dbs electrode
	preopt - pins
	postopt - dbs electrode

QUESTIONS
